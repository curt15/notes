-> [[MHM]] <- 

- [[training log]] vs [[training plan]] -> schedule



--- 

there are two sides to this:
- 1. the recording -> parsing; meaning, getting the recorded training data itself into a pythonic model that is accessible to...
- 2. the analysis <- relationships between exercise types, volume on joints, etc., etc. 
- 2 comes later

--> training
how to handle tracking/presenting the associated time curve function of ...

sleep, eat, drink, shit, piss,

RESTRAIN (RESTful Training/Recovery)

TODO :

- Ability to call specific exercises to data frame and analysis t.upper\_push() ->

--- 

Actions -> Exercises "UPPER PUSH" -> grouping  
                                      "ohPush" -> grouping  
                                        ...  
                                        "**BB** OHP" => implement(s) \+ cname(s)

muscle(s) "triceps 0.7 vol" => volume ratio(s)
                            -> "triceps -> elbow" (joint(s) \=> structural volume(s))
							

Exercise \= joints + muscles + action(s) (=> compound vs isolation)
                                                    (=> main vs auxiliary)

  

Derive joints & muscles from Exercises? (Build implement based rules) 

Exercise name: "BB Bench Press" -> implement: BB/Bar Bell -> cname: Bench Press

new/add concepts:
- Daily dynamic calorie shift via activity inputs

### TODO:

add date to Exercise class?

proofing bodyweight exercises (angles of clination?, limb length var?, time based vol?)
	 - TRX/Suspended angle as “{}” ?

proofing TUT
proofing AR

build cardiore & metconre

add client dependancy to recoverres —> manage folders —> global analysis

add clientstuff.meal_planning_multi for split between multiple people:
	1. get daily macros for each person
	2. determine breakfast, lunch, snacks for each person	
	3. determine recipes for shared meals (dinner)
	4. determine total recipe quantity needed
	5. determine breakdown of servings (& price) per person
