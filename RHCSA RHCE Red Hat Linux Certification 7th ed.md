RHCSA

SA = ch 1-9

**CentOS**
“Community Enterprise Linux The Community Enterprise Operating System (CentOS) rebuild is developed by the group at www.centos.org. This group probably has the largest community among the rebuilds. In 2014, the CentOS project joined the Red Hat community and is currently supported by Red Hat”

“In the same fashion, for the RHCE exam, unless directed to do otherwise, keep everything as simple as possible. Configure a firewall that allows access to just the services specified. Simple firewalls are faster to set up, and many security experts suggest that simple firewalls are safer.”

“There is no way to cram for a Red Hat exam. But like athletes warm up before a race, you can “warm up” before a Red Hat exam. Reread each of the objectives associated with the target exam. Review the “Scenario & Solution” tables available toward the end of most chapters. Reflect on the software that has to be installed, the files that need to be configured, and the key commands that you might have trouble remembering otherwise.
Remember, the Red Hat RHCSA and RHCE exams are designed to test candidate qualifications as Linux systems administrators and engineers. If you pass either of these exams, it’s not because you’ve memorized a canned set of answers—it’s because you have a set of Linux administrative skills and know how to use them under pressure, whether it be during an exam or in a real-world situation.”
